# VPIP-calclator
This is a calculator that calculates the possible hands of an opponent (VPIP) in poker. The program is written in Russian. While using it in practice, I noticed its advantage in real-time tracking. Cons, you need to play a lot of hands so that there are some clear results. For the program to work, the PyQt5 and higher module is needed.  P.s this is my first job, I will be glad of criticism to improve the program and gain new experience for myself.
