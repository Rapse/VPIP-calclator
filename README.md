# VPIP-calclator
This is a calculator that calculates the opponent's possible hands (VPIP, PFR) in poker. The program is written in Russian. It contains vertical and horizontal columns with numbers. Vertical columns and numbers in them mean the number of times a player has deposited money into the bank within one hand and there are 30 such hands in the program. Horizontal columns are needed to count the number of hands. Above the vertical columns there are buttons to reset the result of a particular player, to the right of these buttons there is a start button, and in the lower right corner there is a reset button for all values.

Applying it in practice, I noticed its advantage in real-time tracking. Cons: You need to play a lot of hands to get clear results. The program requires the PyQt5 and higher module to work.


P.S. this is my first job, do not take it harshly. I will be glad to criticism.
